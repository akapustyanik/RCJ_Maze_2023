    Reset all sensors by setting all of their XSHUT pins low for delay(10), then set all XSHUT high to bring out of reset
    Keep sensor #1 awake by keeping XSHUT pin high
    Put all other sensors into shutdown by pulling XSHUT pins low
    Initialize sensor #1 with lox.begin(new_i2c_address) Pick any number but 0x29 and it must be under 0x7F. Going with 0x30 to 0x3F is probably OK.
    Keep sensor #1 awake, and now bring sensor #2 out of reset by setting its XSHUT pin high.
    Initialize sensor #2 with lox.begin(new_i2c_address) Pick any number but 0x29 and whatever you set the first sensor to
